# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the necessary packages (numpy, pandas, SVC, etc).
2. Load the dataset and vectorize text information using CountVectorizer()
3. Fit the data into the model.
4. Check Accuracy Score and Confusion matrix.

## Program:
